### Version Control for Code
----

This is a collection of questions and reflections about the Udacity [How to use Git and GitHub](https://www.udacity.com/course/how-to-use-git-and-github--ud775) course.

__Note about the Course__

> Effective use of version control is an important and useful skill for any developer working on long-lived (or even medium-lived) projects, especially if more than one developer is involved. This course, _built with input from GitHub_, will introduce the basics of using version control by focusing on a particular version control system called Git and a collaboration platform called GitHub.
