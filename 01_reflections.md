### LESSON 01 - REFLECTIONS
----

`How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?`

> Viewing a diff between two versions of a file helped me see the bug that was introduced since it displayed the differences between the two versions of the file.

----

`How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?`

> Having easy access to the entire history of a file helps in becoming a more efficient programmer in the long term since you can easily identify a bug that was introduced between two versions of a file, and revert to an older version of the file at any time (either to correct the bug, or get rid of any change that might no longer be desirable).

----

`What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?`

> Manually choosing when to create a commit makes it easier to have logical commits. Whereas automatically saved versions may lead to a cluttered commit history. On the other hand, making a commit per logical change may result into bigger differences between two versions of a file.

----

`Why do you think some version control systems, like git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?`

> `git` allows saving multiple files in one commit because oftentimes those files are connected and required for the program to function properly. So, for each commit, `git` will track the state of each file, whereas other systems like Google Docs don't.

----

`How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?`

> The command `git` log lists all the commit history of the files that have changed. Then, from there, the `git` diff command run between two commits helps track the differences between those commits.

----

`How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?`

> Using version control makes you more confident to make changes that could break something, because, if your changes do break something, you can easily identify and checkout an earlier version of the code, without the changes that broke it in the first place.

----

`Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using git for?`

> I would like to use `git` with all my programming (and non-programming) projects. Plus, I will definittely be using it while collaborating on open source projects on [GitHub](www.`git`hub.com).
